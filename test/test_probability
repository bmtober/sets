# This is wicked cool.
# 
# You remember the formulas for combining probabilities? Well this is
# where they come from.
# 
# Let's review.
# 
# Given independent events X and Y, if the probability associated with
# event X is P(X) and for Y is P(Y), then the probability of the combined
# event "X and Y" is simply the product
# 
#   P(X and Y) = P(X) P(Y)
# 
# Similarly, the probability of the combined event "X or Y" (which is
# understood to mean "X or Y or both") is the attenuated sum
# 
#   P(X or Y) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X and Y)
# 
# The "and" operation above is, for sets, the "intersection", and the "or"
# operation is "union".
# 
# So if we model the event X as an event with probability P(X) = 0.3
# and the event Y with probability P(Y) = 0.4, for example, the combined
# probabilities will be
# 
#   P(X and Y) = 0.12
# 
#   P(X or Y) = 0.58
# 
# We model the events by drawing random numbers between 1 and 100,000
# (without replacement) for each event.
# 
# shuf -n 30000 -i 1-100000 > X
# shuf -n 40000 -i 1-100000 > Y
# 
# Note that this result is stocastic, so any trial might possibly fail, so
# we run the trials a number of times and average. It still might fail, but
# with low probability, so run the test several times:
